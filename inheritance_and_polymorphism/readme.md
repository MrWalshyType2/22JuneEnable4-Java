Exercises: Using the inheritance and polymorphism example from the demonstration: 

1. Create a new class called Invertebrate which inherits from Animal 

2. The Invertebrate should have a single constructor which initialises the classification field 

3. Add a method called woof() to the Dog class which prints woof woof to the console 

4. Create a class called Cat which inherits from Vertebrate 

5. The Cat class should have constructors for initialising its species 

6. Add a meow() method to the Cat class which prints meowww to the console. 

7. Refactor the existing inheritance hierarchy so that by default, the species field is initialised to Unknown. 

8. Research the names of some invertebrates and create at least 2 classes, each representing a different species of invertebrate. 

9. The subclasses must inherit from the Invertebrate class you created earlier
